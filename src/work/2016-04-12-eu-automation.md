From July 2015, I joined European Automation, an industrial automation parts supplier during my placement year at Staffordshire University. I worked on their internal CRM system; modernizing it with Laravel and learning and improving how the system works. This allowed me to take up the challenge of re-designing their website from the ground up using Laravel, so that the website and the backend system used the same technology stack.

I had just started learning React at the time and I joined my colleagues in iterating on our CRM by progressively enhancing new areas of the system.

We received designs from [ORB](http://www.thisisorb.com), a creative agency in Birmingham, and built it in 6 months ready for the rebrand from European Automation into EU Automation.

It also coincided with a move to Amazon Web Services - both systems in the space of a few days!
